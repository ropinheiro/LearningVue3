# build-a-bot

## Introduction

This repo contains my commits as I learn Vue3 in the Jim Cooper's [Vue.js 3 Fundamentals course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vuejs-fundamentals/table-of-contents) in Pluralsight.

All the code came from the course (even if I do my changes here and there).

Part of it was copied from the helper repo [here](https://github.com/jmcooper/vuejs-fundamentals).

Important note: contrary to original author, I use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

I was able to run the code in the following operative systems and IDE's:

```
OS: Mac or WSL
IDE: Visual Studio Code
```

## Requirements (install this before)
```
npm
nvm
yarn
```

## Requirements (specific versions)
```
nvm install 14.16.0
nvm use 14.16.0
npm install -g @vue/cli@4.5.13
```

## Requirements (other apps)
```
build-a-bot-server (see the sibling folder with the same name)
```

## Project setup (after a fresh clone)
```
yarn install
```
