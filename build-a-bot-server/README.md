# build-a-bot-server

## Introduction

This repo contains a separate server to be used as backend of a Vue.js app being built as as I learn Vue3 in the Jim Cooper's [Vue.js 3 Fundamentals course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vuejs-fundamentals/table-of-contents) in Pluralsight.

Almost everything in this repository was copied from the helper repo [here](https://github.com/jmcooper/build-a-bot-server) with few code changes if any (for my learning's explorations).

Important note: contrary to original author, I use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

I was able to run the server in the following operative systems and IDE's:

```
OS: Mac or WSL
IDE: Visual Studio Code
```

## Requirements
```
npm
nvm
yarn
```

## Project setup (after a fresh clone)
```
yarn install
```

### Start the server
```
yarn start
```
